![Initial Icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upperlinecode/bootstrap-grid-icon-practice/main/icon_start.png)

## The Goal
In this lab, you will practice various complex layouts to build up the crucial skill of determining column size within a grid.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`
2. `cd` into the `bootstrap-grid-emoji` folder
3. Open the file `index.html` and preview it. You should see something that looks a lot like the photo above. 

## The Lab
Your goal is to replicate the layout you see in each challenge by using different column sizes.

Here are a few additional points to keep in mind as you get started:
* There is some pre-built CSS loaded into your stylesheet to get you started. You will need to change any of the CSS to recreate the layouts--the styling provided is meant to help you better visualize the width of each element. 
* Play around with the number 12 to resize your columns. In Bootstrap, grids can contain between 1 and 12 columns per row.
